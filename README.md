# ChatGPT Prompt Engineering for Developers Course- Notes

![2023-08-17 17_52_18-DLAI - Learning Platform Beta](https://github.com/Priyansh-jsk/ChatGPT_PE_LLM/assets/58244081/2ac1e47b-b105-441d-818d-c3455a2ccef9)

The power of Large Language Models(LLM) as a developer tool, that is using API calls to LLMs to quickly build software applications. The importance of prompt engineering will continue to grow as time passes, given the increasing significance of AI and chatbots like ChatGPT in the future.

**_There are two types of LLMs-_**

_**Base LLM**_

-> Predicts next word, based on text training data.

**Input:** _Once upon a time, there was a unicorn_

**output:** _that lived in a magical forest with all her unicorn friends_

**Input:** _What is the capital of France?_ 

**output:** 

_What is France’s largest city?_  

_What is France’s population?_  

_What is the currency of France?_

_**Instruction Turned LLM**_

Tries to follow instructions: 

- Start off with a base LLM that’s been trained on a huge amount of text data.
- Fine-tune on instructions and good attempts at following those instructions.
- They are trained in RLHF (reinforcement learning from human feedback)
- They've been trained to be helpful, honest, and harmless.(e.g.: They're less likely to output toxic tests vs base LLMs).

**Input:** _What is the capital of France?_

**output:** _The captial of France is Paris._


_Load OpenAI Key_

_Model used_

we will use the OpenAI gpt-3.5-turbo model. This helper function will make it easier to use prompts and look at the generated outputs:

**Principles of prompting:**

1. Write clear and specific instructions.
2. Use delimiters like: ```, """, < >, <tag> </tag>, : 
3. Ask for structured output-> HTML, JSON, etc.
4. Check whether conditions are satisfied to do a task.
5. Few examples of the sorts of task prompting completion.
6. Give the model time to think.
7. Specify the steps to output the task, breaking down the solution into neat steps.
8. Make the output in a specified format for better parsing.
9. Instruct the model to find its own solution before rushing to a conclusion.

_**Iterative-prompt-development**_

![2023-08-22 13_43_00-DLAI - Learning Platform Beta](https://github.com/Priyansh-jsk/ChatGPT_PE_LLM/assets/58244081/8c408e0d-430e-4a76-b362-43435dd29828)

**Prompt Guidelines**
- Be clear and specific.
- Analyze why the result does not give the desired output.
- Refine the idea and the prompt.
- Repeat

**Iterative Process**
- Try something.
- Analyze where the result does not give what you want.
- Clarify instructions, and give more time to think.
- Think to Refine prompts with a batch of examples

Iterations are important. There is no perfect prompt, but using a process to improve can help refine ideas and prompts
We have some issues with performing prompt text data. 

**Issue 1:** The text is too long 
Limit the number of words/sentences/characters.

**Issue 2:** Text focuses on the wrong details
Ask it to focus on the aspects that are relevant to the intended audience.

**Issue 3:** Description needs a table of dimensions
Ask it to extract information and organize it in a table.

Let's see now, How to Load Python libraries to view HTML.

**We have the following commands to view HTML.**

_from IPython.display import display, HTML_

_display(HTML(response))_

_**Summarizing**_

There's so much text we see in today's world, But we don't have to read all the things. 
So, Now one of the most exciting applications We have in the world which is the Large Language Model is to use it to summarize text, in an accurate way.

- In summary, give more details about the intent of the summary viewer to help the response from ChatGPT focus on the relevant details from the original content.
- Extract information that removes other parts from the response, in summary, to focus exactly.
- Looping over a list can help summarize product sites quickly.
- Binary responses (positive or negative) can be used to help with programmatic use.
- Extracting a list of emotions from the writer for a text is also possible.

_Summarize with a word/sentence/character limit_

```prod_review =
"""
Got this panda plush toy for my daughter's birthday, \
who loves it and takes it everywhere. It's soft and \ 
super cute, and its face has a friendly look. It's \ 
a bit small for what I paid though. I think there \ 
might be other options that are bigger for the \ 
same price. It arrived a day earlier than expected, \ 
so I got to play with it myself before I gave it \ 
to her.
"""
```

```prompt = f"""
Your task is to generate a short summary of a product \
review from an ecommerce site. 

Summarize the review below, delimited by triple 
backticks, in at most 30 words. 

Review: ```{prod_review}```
"""

response = get_completion(prompt)
print(response)
```

**Output-** This panda plush toy is loved by the reviewer's daughter, but they feel it is a bit small for the price.

_Summarize with a focus on price and value_

```prompt = f"""
Your task is to generate a short summary of a product \
review from an ecommerce site to give feedback to the \
pricing deparmtment, responsible for determining the \
price of the product.  

Summarize the review below, delimited by triple 
backticks, in at most 30 words, and focusing on any aspects \
that are relevant to the price and perceived value. 

Review: ```{prod_review}```
"""

response = get_completion(prompt)
print(response)
```

**Output-** The customer loves the panda plush toy for its softness and cuteness, but feels it is overpriced compared to other options available.

_Try "extract" instead of "summarize"_

```prompt = f"""
Your task is to extract relevant information from \ 
a product review from an ecommerce site to give \
feedback to the Shipping department. 

From the review below, delimited by triple quotes \
extract the information relevant to shipping and \ 
delivery. Limit to 30 words. 

Review: ```{prod_review}```
"""

response = get_completion(prompt)
print(response)
```

**Output-** The shipping department should take note that the product arrived a day earlier than expected.

_Summarize multiple product reviews_
There are three lengthy product reviews to be grouped into a list initially. The second is to implement a Python for loop to run the prompt on all the reviews.

review_1 = prod_review 

# review for a standing lamp
review_2 = """
Needed a nice lamp for my bedroom, and this one \
had additional storage and not too high of a price \
point. Got it fast - arrived in 2 days. The string \
to the lamp broke during the transit and the company \
happily sent over a new one. Came within a few days \
as well. It was easy to put together. Then I had a \
missing part, so I contacted their support, and they \
very quickly got me the missing piece! Seems to me \
to be a great company that cares about their customers \
and products. 
"""

# review for an electric toothbrush
review_3 = """
My dental hygienist recommended an electric toothbrush, \
which is why I got this. The battery life seems to be \
pretty impressive so far. After initial charging and \
leaving the charger plugged in for the first week to \
condition the battery, I've unplugged the charger and \
been using it for twice daily brushing for the last \
3 weeks all on the same charge. But the toothbrush head \
is too small. I’ve seen baby toothbrushes bigger than \
this one. I wish the head was bigger with different \
length bristles to get between teeth better because \
this one doesn’t.  Overall if you can get this one \
around the $50 mark, it's a good deal. The manufactuer's \
replacements heads are pretty expensive, but you can \
get generic ones that're more reasonably priced. This \
toothbrush makes me feel like I've been to the dentist \
every day. My teeth feel sparkly clean!
"""

```reviews = [review_1, review_2, review_3]```

```
for i in range(len(reviews)):
    prompt = f"""
    Your task is to generate a short summary of a product \ 
    review from an ecommerce site. 

    Summarize the review below, delimited by triple \
    backticks in at most 20 words. 

    Review: ```{reviews[i]}```
    """

    response = get_completion(prompt)
    print(i, response, "\n")

**Output-** 
0 Panda plush toy is loved by daughter, soft and cute, but small for the price. Arrived early. 

1 Great lamp with storage, fast delivery, excellent customer service, and easy assembly. Highly recommended. 

2 The reviewer recommends the electric toothbrush for its impressive battery life but criticizes the small brush head.

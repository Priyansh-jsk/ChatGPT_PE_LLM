**Principles of prompting:**

1. Write clear and specific instructions.
2. Use delimiters like quotes("""), ''', ---, <>, <tag> </tag> etc.
3. Ask for structured output-> HTML, JSON etc.
4. Check wheather conditions are satisfied to do a task.
5. Few examples of the sorts of task prompting completion.
6. Give the model time to think.
7. Specify the steps to output the task in, breaking down the solution into neat steps.
8. Make the output in a specified format for better parsing.
9. Instruct the model to find its own solution before rushing to a conclusion.
10. Iterations are important. There is no perfect prompt, but using a process to improve can help refine ideas and prompts.
